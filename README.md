# CSPBot - Crowdsignal Poll's Bot to autovote seemlessly

Version 1.0.1

The code can:
- select an option of a give Crowdsignal poll;
- confirm vote;
- redirect in case the cooldown was activated;
- count votes so the user can see

Note that the votes casted after the cooldown activated might not be 
counted by certain amount of time if it is IP blocked. If not, it will 
count normally. 

This initial code can work manually by copy/paste. Needs editing in case
the polls are other.
